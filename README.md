## About

This web app is a helper tool for playing a variant for [Eldritch Horror Board Game](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/eldritch-horror/). The variant was created by the user [Josip](https://boardgamegeek.com/user/Batela) from BGG. You can find more about the variant on his [thread](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2890913/mythos-phase-chaos-bag-variant) and the PDF rules on this [link](https://s3.amazonaws.com/geekdo-files.com/bgg347250?response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3D%22Eldritch_Horror_Chaos_Bag_Variant.pdf%22&response-content-type=application%2Fpdf&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAJYFNCT7FKCE4O6TA%2F20230228%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20230228T014448Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=120&X-Amz-Signature=ae959df2b9fe1d0651d5d464a78c44bcd933d6f716f166e020eca0c907988b2f). 

In a regular game of Eldritch Horror, the player must build the Mythos Deck before each game based on the Ancient One. The Mythos Phase is the bigger part of the game and tends to slow down the flow of the game with a lot of effects and bad/good stuff triggering more effects.

The variant streamline the Mythos Phase using a bag of tokens like the [Arkham Horror card game](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/arkham-horror-the-card-game/). After the player spends his actions he/she must get one token from the bag, each token containing a singular effect from the Mythos Phase. Read more about the thread for a deeper explanation.

## Goal

In order to play the Chaos Bag variant, you must print the tokens and a bag to play. SSo if you want to  try the variant without all the hassle of printing and setting up the bag, you can use this tool, which will follow all rules from the variant.

## How to use

Select an Ancient One from the list and the number of players then click start. Just click on the Get Token button and follow the effect description. The game auto saves, so if you close the app you can resume to the game. You can access the tool on this link:
